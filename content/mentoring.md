In my free time I offer private mentoring to people passionate about computer science; required some basic knowledge of programming and being motivated.
\
\
\
My coaching style is goal oriented with minimal theory. Hands-on experience first then you expands knowledges on your own, following your curiousity and your needs.
\
\
\
Some of the topics I've covered with past students are :
- github,markdown and making coding a habit
- minimizing mental friction
- build your portfolio page and blog
- workspace optimization
- publish your first mobile app
- the programming landscape
- modern fullstack web frameworks

Additionaly if you are interested in writing better software, I do code review for the following languages: Python, Swift, Javascript.
